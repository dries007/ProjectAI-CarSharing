\section{Problem description}
    The Cambio car sharing project lets you make a reservation for a car at a specific time in a specific zone.
    The goal of this optimization problem is to find the most optimal location for each car, in order to assign as many reservations as possible
    in one city.
    
    The city has been divided into zones, every car has a vehicle type and each reservation consists of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A required zone;
        \item A start and end date and time;
        \item A type of vehicle.
    \end{itemize} 

    This means a request can only be assigned to the required zone, or a neighboring zone. Only cars of the right type can be used for a reservation.
    And of-course a reservation can only be assigned if a car is free for the entire duration of the reservation.

    The goal is to assign each car to a zone, and assign each reservation to a car. No limit has been specified for the amount of cars assigned to one zone.

    The cost of this problem has to be as low as possible, and can be calculated as shown in formula~\ref{f:cost} where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are penalty factors.

    \begin{equation}
        \label{f:cost}
        cost = P_1 * \#Not assigned + P_2 * \#Assigned to neighbor
    \end{equation}

\section{Our approach}
    \subsection{Data structures and representation}
        \subsubsection{Request, Zone and Car}
            Requests and zones are parsed into objects of their respective class containing all fields necessary to store the input data in basic types like integers, strings and lists.
            Cars do not have a custom object, they are represented with a simple string on the request object.

            After parsing the input data, all request and zone objects are stored in 2 lists, and in a dictionary for fast lookup by id. 
        
        \subsection{Solution}
            A solution is represented by a Solution object. This object contains a reference to the lists with parsed input data, and 2 dictionary's.
            These dictionary's represent the relationship between a car and zone, and between a request and a car.
            The cost function can be calculated based on the car\textunderscore zone and req\textunderscore car dictionary's.

        \subsection{Auxiliary data structures}
            To speed up the calculation process, we created some extra data structures with pre-calculated data.

            The first structure is the overlap matrix. This 2D-matrix represents the overlapping of 2 requests, this allows for a fast feasibility check because
            the slow overlap checking loop is pre-calculated.
